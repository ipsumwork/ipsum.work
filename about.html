            Typography could be placed on a spectrum where very decorative fonts are on one side and more minimalist ones on the other. Coming from a background in graffiti culture, I have primarily explored the decorative side of the spectrum, which has led me to be interested in fonts and letters from a very young age. By only combining lines and curves, I create an infinite variety of expressions and messages. There are really no rules defining how letters should look in graffiti, other than that they must be in public spaces and preferably painted without financial means. But when the average person thinks of graffiti letters, most likely they envision heavily distorted shapes that appear very abstract to someone unfamiliar with the form. Despite it seeming "random" how the letters are constructed, there are still strict rules that must be followed to create a letter.

In this project, I will primarily focus on tags within graffiti. Since tags are the form of graffiti that most closely resembles "traditional" fonts, as they are only constructed of solid curves and lines. In this project, with the help of a super strict grid system, I will create fonts. The grid will serve as a template indicating how letters are constructed. By making all the fonts variable, I want to loosen up the strict grid. I aim to bridge tags and a more traditional font, where they both meet in an organized and organic chaos. The fonts will be presented in a book where I will break down and attempt to explain the construction and design of the letters. I want the fonts to be able to live on beyond the project, so I will create a website that will serve as a font foundry where fonts can be tested and downloaded for personal use.

If we simplify it, a letter can look like anything, it's up to the creator of the letter to determine what letter it should be. However, if one creates a letter that is supposed to function in the Latin alphabet, certain rules are required for all people to agree that it is the letter R, for example. The building blocks for an R must be there for it to be an R. If the leg of the R becomes too twisted so that it connects with the back of the R, it would become a B. This means that you can twist and turn letters as much as you want, but the fundamental structure must always remain. This can be applied to regular fonts, in the sense of fonts we see around us on signs, in books, and digitally.

According to Wikipedia, a type foundry is a company that creates and distributes fonts. The word "foundry" is the English translation for "hytta," which is an iron and glass casting. The reason it's called a foundry in terms of fonts is because before digital fonts, letters were cast in lead, which was then used to print letters. In my type foundry, I will design all the fonts based on my square grid, meaning the relationship between the letters will be monospaced. What constitutes the characteristic features of a monospace font is that they have the same x-width. Each letter, number, and symbol occupies the same horizontal and vertical space. Unlike a variable-width font, the narrow letters like i and 1 take up less space, while M and W are larger than the other letters. The reason monospace fonts have these characteristics is due to typewriters; each time a key is pressed, it jumps the same distance from each letter, creating a monospace.

Grid systems have been a significant part of graphic design and typography since the early 20th century. Swiss design has become the cornerstone of how the Western world views graphic design today, through their use of grid systems. Grid systems create a framework for how text and images should relate to each other. However, there is not one system, but something each designer creates themselves according to their needs. According to Josef Müller-Brockman in "Grid Systems in Graphic Design" (1981), he describes the function of the grid system as follows:

"The use of the grid system implies the will to systematize, to clarify the will to penetrate to the essentials, to concentrate the will to cultivate objectivity instead of subjectivity the will to rationalize the creative and technical production processes…"

My grid system consists of an 8x8 grid consisting of 1x1 squares. This grid will be the foundation of all the letters in all the fonts. I made the grid as simple as possible to really highlight the fundamental construction of the letters. This font will then be used throughout all parts of the project, from the smallest glyph to how I set text in the book, to the images, to the relationship between text and images, the book's form, the website, and the exhibition design. From the smallest to the largest. This means that all parts, regardless of size, will be able to interlock, like a puzzle.

"Mise en place" is a French term usually associated with cooking and directly translated would mean "placement in place." In cooking, it means that before you start cooking, you prepare the ingredients and utensils in such a way that the preparation is streamlined. In the same way, I will systematically and organizedly create fonts and use my grid to place the construction of the letters in their place. To create these fonts, I will use Glyphs 3, one of the world's leading software programs for font manufacturing. What I did to ensure that all the letters in all the fonts are cast from the same foundation was that I first created an 8x8 grid of 70 pts squares. Why each square was 70 pts was somewhat arbitrary, as the last time I opened Glyphs was three years earlier. This led to some confusion about why certain decisions were made. You could say that I didn't really know what I was doing, and many hours were spent trying to understand what people meant in Glyphs forum threads. Creating each font became very time-consuming partly because it takes a long time to create a font, and partly because I had to learn along the way. This meant that not only due to the simplicity of the grid but also time-wise, I had to keep all the fonts relatively simple in their form. Instead, the focus was on finding tricks to make the fonts more interesting in their extremes, from super-thin to super-bold, for example.

The first font I started with was "Holes mono," which is a font built of circles in an 8x8 grid. Where each circle sits in the middle of each square, which means that the letters can only have horizontal and vertical lines. This means that letters with a curved or slanted stem (e.g., B, P, O, D with curved stems and M, W, K, with slanted stems) must be adapted so that they still become the correct letter. Holes mono is variable in its weight, where each circle from the smallest 10 pts can be enlarged from the center point of the circles up to 300 pts. What happens with the letters in the higher weight is that the circles start to "bleed" into each other and the basics of the letters disappear so that they only leave behind a silhouette of the letter or words. This is intended to mimic how color works against a surface where the color starts to bleed into itself if applied enough. Mono, named after the title "mise en place," is a monospace grotesque font. It came about because I began to annoy myself trying to achieve my own rules. I felt I needed a font that is more balanced and legible since I will use this font as body text in the book.

The second font is "Lines mono," which is a font made up of horizontal and vertical lines in an 8x8 grid. The rules for this font are that lines must not overlap, and every square must contain at least one line. Lines mono is also a variable font, but unlike Holes mono, the lines are only one pt wide. This means that they can only be as thick as one pt, and the only way to achieve a bolder weight is to create more lines next to each other. This gives Lines mono a limit as to how thick or thin it can be. In the heavier weights, it begins to look like a screen where the individual lines are too close together, and the black mass is all that is visible. In the lighter weights, the individual lines are visible, and the letters start to dance a little. Mono is named after the title "mise en place" and is also a monospace grotesque font. It came about because I wanted to see how far I could push the design.

The third font is "Circles mono," which is a font made up of circles in an 8x8 grid. Where each circle sits in the middle of each square, which means that the letters can only have horizontal and vertical lines. Circles mono is variable in its weight, where each circle from the smallest 10 pts can be enlarged from the center point of the circles up to 300 pts. What happens with the letters in the higher weight is that the circles start to "bleed" into each other and the basics of the letters disappear so that they only leave behind a silhouette of the letter or words. This is intended to mimic how color works against a surface where the color starts to bleed into itself if applied enough. Mono is named after the title "mise en place" and is also a monospace grotesque font. It came about because I wanted to experiment with a font that was entirely made up of circles.
